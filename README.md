# JavaScript-Tutorial
Single page website that gives a short tutorial on some JavaScript code.

This was an in-house project, where each team was to create a different step-by-step guide on how to do different things in JavaScript. Our team was in charge of creating a page that showed customers on how to add items to a list using JavaScript. Furthermore, since this was a new tutorial, we were also tasked with coming up with a design that would then be used for all the other tutorials in this series. The approach on this was for our team to come up with a design that would compete against other teamâ€™s design, and to make a tutorial that would then join the tutorials that were made from the other teams.
